# machine's IP (203-0-113-5.sslip.io), or only this machine to try it first. With a domain, Caddy
# gets an HTTPS certificate for it automatically (the name must point at this machine, with ports
# 80 and 443 open); the installer checks both and says what to fix. Run it again any time to update.
# Settings, without the questions: SAYQL_DOMAIN, SAYQL_DIR (default ~/sayql), SAYQL_ADMIN_EMAIL.
# Behind your own HTTPS proxy: SAYQL_BEHIND_PROXY=1 serves the server on port 8080, with no Caddy.
# The checks ask sayql.dev/api/setup-check, sending only the domain; SAYQL_NO_CHECK=1 skips them.
