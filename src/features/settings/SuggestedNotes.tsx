        AI apps can suggest a note about a database (a table that's no longer used, what a code means) with what they
        checked, and suggest fixing or removing a note that looks out of date. Nothing changes until you accept it;
        accepted notes go to the Ask box, agent mode and every AI app using SayQL. You also see a database's suggestions
        under Notes in the navigator.
