const INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "SayQL gives read-only access to the user's saved database connections \
(PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server). Typical flow: list_connections, then list_databases for a \
server connection, then describe_schema (pass `search` terms for large databases), then run_query (page with `offset`). \
Queries run read-only and the database itself enforces it where it can; statements that could change \
data are refused, and the user must run those in the SayQL app. Keep results small (TOP/LIMIT) and \
select only the columns you need. To hand work to the user in the SayQL app: add_connection opens a \
prefilled New connection dialog (never pass a password; the user types it in SayQL), and open_query \
opens SQL in a new SayQL tab for the user to review and run (use it for statements that change data). \
list_scripts shows the user's saved scripts; open_script opens one in SayQL. export_csv saves a read-only \
query's rows (up to 100,000) to a CSV file in the user's Downloads folder without returning them. \
describe_schema includes notes the user saved about the database (what codes mean, how tables relate); \
trust them. It also shows each table's usage from the database's own statistics (reads, writes, last write, \
and the period they cover), so you can tell a live table from an abandoned one. When you learn a lasting \
schema-level fact (a table is unused and replaced, what a status code means, how two tables relate), call \
suggest_note with the note and your evidence: notes describe the database, never row values or personal data, \
and a suggestion only becomes a note when the user accepts it in SayQL. Some columns are marked never to send to AI \
(describe_schema shows them as [never sent to AI]): a query that could read them in any form (named, in WHERE or COUNT, \
a whole row such as row_to_json(t) or t::text, * inside a subquery, a column alias list) is refused, so name the \
columns you need and leave those out; SELECT * returns them withheld. \
The user chooses, per connection, what you may see of results (`ai_may_see` in list_connections): `off` (row \
counts and column names only), `counts` (the default: row counts and per-column summaries: type, nulls, distinct \
count, and min/max only for a table's own number or date columns and counts, sums, averages, min or max of them), \
`masked` (rows, with likely personal data replaced by tokens such as ‹email-1›, which can't be used in later \
queries; text whose source SayQL can't trace, after UNION, VALUES or JSON access, is masked too) or `all` (rows as \
they are). Below `all`, database error messages are replaced by a fixed description of the error, since they can \
quote values. Below `all`, answer with queries whose counts, sums or averages answer \
the question, and use open_query when the user wants to see rows: they see them in SayQL, you don't. \
export_csv works only where the user allows `all`.";

const OFF_NOTE: &str = "The user lets AI apps see only row counts and column names on this connection. \

Min and max are shown only for a table's own number and date columns and for COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN or MAX of them. \

they can. Ask the user to open SayQL to fix them.";
const MASKED_NOTE: &str = "Likely personal data is replaced by tokens such as ‹email-1›. They stand for real values in \
this result only; they can't be used in later queries.";
const EXPORT_OFF: &str = "The user hasn't allowed AI apps to see all rows on this connection, so export_csv is off \
here. Use open_query to put the query in a SayQL tab: the user can run it and save the rows from there.";
