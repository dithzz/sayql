//! The audit: instructions for an AI app working in the person's code (Claude Code, Cursor)
//! to teach SayQL about a database. The app reads the schema, its usage figures and the saved
//! notes, checks them against the code, and suggests notes with `suggest_note`, including
//! corrections and removals of notes that look outdated. Served as the MCP prompt `audit`
//! (`/mcp__sayql__audit` in Claude Code) and copied from the app for AI apps without prompts.

         (reads, writes, last write, and the period they cover; SQLite keeps none), and it ends with the notes already \
         saved, each with an id such as [n_1a2b3c4d].\n\
         2. Search {code}for where each table and its main columns are used: queries, ORM models, migrations, raw SQL, \
         jobs and scripts.\n\
         3. Look for what the schema doesn't say:\n\
         - tables that are unused or retired: no references in the code and no writes in the usage period (say so \
         when usage isn't available), and what replaced them;\n\
         - what status and type codes, enum values and flags mean, as the code defines them;\n\
         - relationships the code relies on that aren't declared as foreign keys;\n\
         - units, currencies, time zones and conventions such as soft deletes (amounts in cents, timestamps in UTC, \
         deleted_at set means deleted).\n\
         4. Check the notes already saved against the code and the usage. For one that's wrong or outdated, call \
         suggest_note with `replaces` set to its id and the corrected note as `text`. For one that no longer applies, \
         call suggest_note with `replaces` set to its id, `remove: true`, and why as `text`.\n\
         5. For each finding, call suggest_note with {args}, the note as `text` (at most 300 characters) and your \
         evidence (at most 600 characters): {evidence}. When a query can confirm the note, add it as `check`: one \
         read-only SQL statement returning exactly one row with one column named `ok`, true while the note holds \
         (`SELECT count(*) = 0 AS ok FROM orders WHERE status NOT IN ('p', 'r')`); leave it out otherwise. Notes are schema-level \
         facts: never values from rows or personal data (names, emails, amounts, ids). Status codes and enum names \
         (`1=pending`, `status IN (2,3)`), SQL, file paths and units are fine. SayQL refuses suggestions that \
         look like values. You need no rows for this; if you run a query to check something, keep its results out of the notes.\n\
         6. Keep to the 10 to 20 most useful notes: facts that change how someone writes a query. Skip what the schema \
         already says (types, declared foreign keys) and notes already saved.\n\
         7. Finish with a short summary for the user: how many notes you suggested, how many replace or remove saved \
         ones, and anything you weren't sure of. Tell them the suggestions wait in SayQL (under Notes in the \
         navigator, and in Settings → AI apps → Suggestions) and nothing is saved until they accept it.\n"
