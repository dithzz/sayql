# Database compatibility

What SayQL was tested against, what each check covers, what was fixed, and what isn't supported. The
tests behind it are in `src-tauri/src/db/integration_tests.rs` and `src-tauri/src/mcp.rs`.
`scripts/test-databases.sh` reruns them against every version below, and CI runs three combinations on every
pull request (the `integration` job). Last full run: 2026-10-22, against real servers in Docker.

¹ The Docker images of these versions don't enable TLS, so "Require SSL" correctly fails, with a message
saying to turn it off. PostgreSQL 16 and 17 were run with TLS on.
² MySQL 5.7 has no `WITH` or window functions; SayQL passes the server's error through.
³ Not run against SQLite in this audit. The code path is the same as for the other databases, and the
demo-store test covers SQLite reads, writes and row estimates.

**Not tested:** Azure SQL Edge (see below), Azure SQL itself (needs a cloud account; SayQL follows its
gateway redirects), PostGIS types (the plain `postgres` images don't include it), Windows/Entra sign-in.

## What each check covers

- **Connect:** PostgreSQL `md5` (13, 15) and `scram-sha-256` (16, 17). MySQL `caching_sha2_password` and
  `mysql_native_password` (8.4 started with `--mysql-native-password=ON`). SSL off and required. Wrong
  password, host, port and database. A user that can only `SELECT`.
- **Schema:** two schemas with a foreign key between them, views, materialized views, composite primary keys,
  enums (including same-named enums in different schemas), and mixed-case, accented, space-containing and
  reserved-word names. Also partitioned tables, and 500 tables of 11 columns. Reading the 500 took 1.2 s on
  PostgreSQL, 0.2 s on MySQL and 0.4 s on SQL Server (emulated).
- **Types:**
  - json/jsonb, uuid, arrays (nested, with NULLs), numeric at full precision, money;
  - date, time, timestamp with and without time zone, interval, infinity;
  - bytea/blob/varbinary, bit, boolean, point and geometry;
  - MySQL zero dates, SQL Server datetimeoffset, uniqueidentifier, nvarchar, xml and sql_variant;
  - NULLs, 200,000-character text, emoji.
- **Read-only:** about 50 statements per dialect, run two ways: through the app's read-only path, and
  straight inside the read-only transaction with SayQL's check skipped, to see what the database stops on
  its own. They include:
  - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, DDL, TRUNCATE;
  - `SELECT … INTO`, `INTO OUTFILE`, COPY, CALL/EXEC of writing procedures;
  - writing functions, `nextval`, LOCK, temp tables, SET, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` of a write;
  - `COMMIT` inside a script, dynamic SQL;
  - writes hidden in each dialect's comments and strings.

  Every write was refused or sent to confirmation, and data never changed. MCP `run_query` and `export_csv`
  refuse them outright.

## Fixed in this audit

1. **MySQL 5.7 couldn't connect at all.** With SSL off, the TLS handshake failed (5.7 offers no cipher suite
   rustls accepts) and SayQL stopped. It now falls back to an unencrypted connection, as MySQL's own
   `PREFERRED` mode does.
2. **"Pool timed out" instead of the real reason** when a port was closed or a host unreachable, after 10
   seconds. It now says `Could not reach host:port: Connection refused` at once.
3. **PostgreSQL read-only logins saw no primary keys.** `information_schema` hides constraints from roles with
   only SELECT. Materialized views were missing too. Partitions were listed one by one, and on PostgreSQL 13
   the partitioned table claimed ~0 rows.
4. **The AI got names it couldn't use.** `FirstName` (PostgreSQL), `first name` and `order` were written
   unquoted in the schema text, so generated queries failed. They're now quoted per dialect.
5. **"Fix with AI" was blind on SQL Server.** The masking that hides values before an error goes to the AI
   hid the whole SQL Server message. PostgreSQL errors ended in "at line 414", a line in Postgres' source
   code, and lacked DETAIL and HINT.
6. **Lasting effects ran in read-only mode.** These passed the check, and a read-only transaction allows them:
   - creating and dropping PostgreSQL replication slots;
   - `pg_stat_reset`;
   - session advisory locks and MySQL `GET_LOCK`.

   They now need confirmation. `SHOW CREATE TABLE` no longer does.
7. **Confirmed statements leaked session state.** After a confirmed `USE`, about one query in four ran in the
   other database, and `SET`, locks and session settings stayed on one pooled connection. Each confirmed
   statement now gets its own connection.
8. **SQL Server showed no rows for confirmed statements** like `INSERT … OUTPUT` or `DECLARE …; SELECT`.
9. **MySQL zero dates showed as NULL**, geometry as `<geometry>`, and SQL Server's unnamed columns had
   blank headers.

## Known limitations

- **No cancel or timeout for a running query.** A long query runs until the server finishes it, and on SQL
  Server it holds the connection's only slot until then. Run heavy queries with a `LIMIT`/`TOP`, or set a
  server-side limit for the login, such as `statement_timeout` (PostgreSQL), `max_execution_time` (MySQL) or
  the Resource Governor (SQL Server).
- **MySQL and MariaDB don't stop DDL in a read-only transaction.** DDL commits the transaction and runs.
  SayQL's own check refuses every DDL statement in read-only mode, and prepared statements prevent smuggling
  a second statement in. But the database isn't a second line of defense here, so use a login with only
  `SELECT` (below).
- **SQL Server has no read-only transaction.** Reads run in a transaction that is always rolled back, and
  SayQL refuses anything that could write. A procedure that commits defeats the rollback, so `EXEC` always
  needs confirmation. Use a `db_datareader` login.
- **MySQL 5.7 with "Require SSL" can't connect,** for the same cipher reason as fix 1. Connect without it, or
  through an SSH tunnel.
- **MariaDB `ed25519` accounts can't sign in.** The driver doesn't support that plugin, and the server
  reports it as "Access denied". Use `mysql_native_password` for SayQL's login.
- **Values shown approximately:**
  - SQL Server `money` above about 900 billion loses its last digits (the driver returns a float);
  - SQL Server `geometry`, `geography` and `hierarchyid` show as hex, so use `.STAsText()` or `.ToString()`;
  - MariaDB's JSON shows as text (MariaDB stores it as text).
- **Privileged logins can read server files** with `pg_read_file` or `LOAD_FILE`. These are reads, so
  read-only mode allows them. Don't connect as a superuser.
- **SQLite runs every statement in one call,** and their rows come back under the first statement's
  columns. The editor sends one statement at a time, so this only shows through MCP `run_query`.
- **Azure SQL Edge** crashes on startup under Docker on Apple silicon, and Microsoft has retired it, so it
  wasn't used as an Azure SQL stand-in. Azure SQL behaves like SQL Server 2022 for everything SayQL does,
  plus the gateway redirect SayQL follows.

## Setup: a read-only login for SayQL

SayQL's read-only mode is a safety net. A login that can only read makes the database enforce it too. All
the checks above passed with logins like these.

**PostgreSQL**
```sql
CREATE ROLE sayql_reader LOGIN PASSWORD '…';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE app TO sayql_reader;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO sayql_reader;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO sayql_reader;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO sayql_reader;
ALTER ROLE sayql_reader SET statement_timeout = '60s';
```

**MySQL / MariaDB**
```sql
CREATE USER 'sayql_reader'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '…';
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW ON app.* TO 'sayql_reader'@'%';
```

**SQL Server / Azure SQL** (in the database)
```sql
CREATE LOGIN sayql_reader WITH PASSWORD = '…';   -- on Azure SQL: CREATE USER sayql_reader WITH PASSWORD = '…'
CREATE USER sayql_reader FOR LOGIN sayql_reader;
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER sayql_reader;
```

**SQLite:** SayQL already opens the file read-only for reads. To be sure, make the file read-only in your
file system.
